Link_Data_set = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TDey84SnvCukwnsebZ-1hmq2KG6PfLTu

Consider a dataset containing various demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of Egyptian pa-
tients who underwent treatment dosages for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) over a period of 18 months.

The dataset includes features such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), symptoms like fever,
nausea/vomiting, headache, diarrhea, fatigue & generalized bone ache, jaundice, epigastric pain, as
well as laboratory measurements like white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC),
hemoglobin (HGB), platelet count (Plat), and levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT) at different time
points. Additionally, RNA measurements at different time points (RNA Base, RNA 4, RNA 12, RNA
EOT, RNA EF) are included, which are indicators of the response to treatment. The target variable
for classification is the ”Baseline histological staging”, representing the severity or stage of liver disease
at the beginning of the treatment.

Your task is to perform classification on the ”Baseline histological staging” column using various
classifiers. Feel free to use classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Ensemble models etc. The
more the merrier !
